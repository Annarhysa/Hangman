You guess by picking letters from those displayed on the screen above the blanks. You will have 8 chances to guess the word. If you pick a letter that is in the word, the letter will placed in the respective blank in word; however, if you pick a letter that is not in the word, a statement saying, "Oops! You've already guessed that letter", will be displayed. Also your number of chances to guess the word will gradually reduce. With 0 chances in hand the word (answer) will be displayed on the screen. If you correctly guess the word you will see "Congratulations, you won!" displayed on the screen. <br>
